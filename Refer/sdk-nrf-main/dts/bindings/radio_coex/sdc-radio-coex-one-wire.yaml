    This is a representation of an external radio coexistence setup that has a
    one-pin control interface (GRANT). This extends that interface with
    additional parameters.

            Concurrency mode with the external modem supported by 1-wire coexistence.
            The possible values are:
            0: 1-wire configuration to allow no concurrency with the external modem
               when the grant line is asserted.
            1: 1-wire configuration to allow the radio to allow RX mode concurrency
               with the external modem when the grant line is asserted.
