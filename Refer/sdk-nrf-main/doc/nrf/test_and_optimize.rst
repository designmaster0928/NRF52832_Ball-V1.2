Testing and optimization
########################

Each :ref:`applications` and :ref:`samples` in the |NCS| come with their own testing instructions.
However, the |NCS| provides a common set of features and options for debugging and optimizing the application performance.
This includes a multilevel logging system that can be enabled and configured independently for different modules, and support for writing unit tests using Unity and CMock.
