config LTE_CONNECTIVITY_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE
	int "Workqueue stack size"
	default 1024
	help
	  Stack size of the internal workqueue.

config LTE_CONNECTIVITY_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
	int "Connect timeout in seconds"
	default 0
	help
	  Time period in seconds that the library will try to establish an LTE connection,
	  before timing out. The connect timeout can be updated by calling
	  conn_mgr_if_set_timeout(). Default value is 0 (timeout disabled).
	  When the timeout is disabled, the library relies solely on the modem's internal
	  connection handling to upkeep the connection.

config LTE_CONNECTIVITY_CONNECTION_PERSISTENCE
	bool "Connection persistency"
	default y
	help
	  Persistent connection. If the connection is lost the modem will try to reconnect
	  itself without the need for explicit calls to the network interface.
	  Persistence can be updated run-time by calling conn_mgr_if_set_flag() with
	  CONN_MGR_IF_PERSISTENT as flag parameter.

config LTE_CONNECTIVITY_AUTO_CONNECT
	bool "Auto connect"
	default y
	help
	 If this option is set the Connection Manager will automatically call connect after the
	 network interface has been brought up. This option sets the default value, the option has
	 a corresponding flag that can be set at run time by calling conn_mgr_if_set_flag().

config LTE_CONNECTIVITY_AUTO_DOWN
	bool "Auto down"
	default y
	help
	 If this option is set the Connection Manager will automatically take the network interface
	 down when it stops trying to connect. This option sets the default value, the option has
	 a corresponding flag that can be set at run time by calling conn_mgr_if_set_flag().
